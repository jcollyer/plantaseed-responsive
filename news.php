				<p>We hosted our first potluck party featuring Comedian Jerry Winn, DJ/Performer Jason Khera, and an amazing group of friends, food and drinks! Next event will be soon, Facebook event to follow!</p>
				<br />
				<p>Here is a little inside to why I (Ruth) for one care so much. While in school in Cameroon-Africa, we use to love the quote, "Give a man a fish; you have fed him for today. Teach a man to fish; and you have fed him for a lifetime". Our hope is that with your support, together we can give these kids the opportunity to learn how to fish for themselves down the road. The future of third world countries depends on it. </p>

				<h4>Young Boys FC</h4>
				<br />
				<iframe class="iframeClass" width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/yUNWsid3DHo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<p>Young Boys FC. A group young men coming together through sports to help one another become better members of the community by encouraging education, good behavior and financial support when need be.</p>
				<br />
				<p>As was promised last month, a monthly report on the status of the team will be provided every month.
				February has been a pretty good month for YBFC and we hope that March will carry the same goodness. We ended the regular season of our first season in the top flight unbeaten.  We are currently in the knockout phase where under hard struggle, we made it past the quarterfinal stage. We are poised to take on to the semifinals where we left off last year and hope to get past that into the finals and by the grace of the Almighty and our hard work, win the championship.</p>
